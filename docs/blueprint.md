# **App Name**: RateCon TurboScan

## Core Features:

- Image Upload and Display: Enable users to upload Rate Con documents (scanned images or photos).
- Automated Data Extraction: Employ OCR and NLP to automatically extract key data fields (Load #, Shipper, Consignee, Weight, Amount, etc.) from the uploaded Rate Con documents. Display the extracted data in a user-friendly, editable table.
